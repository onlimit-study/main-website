## What is ON LiMiT?

ON LiMiT (Optimal Non-pharmacological LifeStyle Modifications in people
with type 2 diabetes) is a large randomized controlled intervention
study conducted in collaboration with the Steno Diabetes Centres in
Aarhus, Odense, and Copenhagen, as well as the University of Copenhagen
and Bispebjerg Hospital.

The aim of the trial is to investigate whether it is possible to achieve
and maintain remission of type 2 diabetes through weight loss and
lifestyle changes.

The project runs from 2025 to 2030 and involves approximately 1,500
participants with type 2 diabetes.

## Why ON LiMiT?

The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes places pressure on the
healthcare system and affects patients’ quality of life. In 2023, there
were 323,094 people with type 2 diabetes in Denmark, and within the last
12 months, 25,001 people have been diagnosed with the disease. In
addition, it is estimated that a further 100,000 people are living with
undiagnosed type 2 diabetes. Weight loss and lifestyle changes have been
shown to lead to remission, but knowledge is lacking regarding how
remission can best be maintained.

## What is diabetes remission?

Remission is defined as measured HbA1c \<48 mmol/mol (long-term blood
glucose) for at least 3 months after discontinuation of diabetes
medication.

## What does the trial involve?

Participants will first undergo a 12-week weight loss program using a
very low-calorie diet, with the aim of achieving a weight loss of more
than 10% of their body weight. Subsequently, participants will be
randomly allocated to one of four groups:

-   A carbohydrate-reduced diet combined with exercise
-   A carbohydrate-reduced diet without exercise
-   A carbohydrate-rich diet combined with exercise
-   A carbohydrate-rich diet without exercise

Participants’ results will be compared with results from trial subjects
who follow standard treatment and who have not undergone a weight loss
program.

## Dietary intervention

The goal is to achieve a 25 E% difference in carbohydrate intake between
the two diets.

Participants on the carbohydrate-reduced diet must consume a maximum of
25–30 E% from carbohydrates, while participants on the carbohydrate-rich
diet must consume at least 50–55 E% from carbohydrates. There will be no
restrictions on intake of fat, protein, or dietary fiber, but added
sugar should be limited to \<5 E% in both diets.

Participants will still be advised to follow recommendations for
high-quality carbohydrate and fat intake in accordance with dietary
guidelines for diabetes.

To make the diets more sustainable, a large proportion of the protein
content will come from non-animal sources.

## Exercise intervention

Participants are instructed to participate in three exercise sessions
per week, including two supervised 60-minute sessions and one
unsupervised session, during which a smartwatch is used to monitor
intensity. Exercise must be performed at an intensity above 70% of
maximal heart rate and/or reach a score of at least 7 on the Rating of
Perceived Exertion (RPE) scale. For resistance training, this
corresponds to having 1–3 repetitions in reserve or an intensity
classified as vigorous according to the American College of Sports
Medicine.

The focus will be on high-intensity aerobic exercise performed
intermittently rather than as a fixed combination of aerobic and
resistance modalities. Although a combined approach is more effective at
reducing HbA1c than each modality alone, high-intensity aerobic exercise
is prioritized in cases where adherence to resistance training is
challenging or where facility access does not allow resistance training.

Expected results The primary aim is to investigate the proportion of
participants who achieve medication-free remission after 104 weeks (2
years) in the group receiving a carbohydrate-reduced diet combined with
exercise, compared with the control group.

In addition, other parameters will be examined, such as changes in
HbA1c, time until HbA1c exceeds 48 mmol/mol, body weight, any type of
remission (with or without medication), clinical risk markers (waist
circumference, body fat, blood pressure, blood lipids, kidney function),
glucose homeostasis, health economics, and the environmental impact of
the diets.

## Future application

Since weight loss is central to remission, we will test a new approach
in which we induce a substantial initial weight loss using low-calorie
meal replacements, followed by healthy and sustainable dietary regimens
combined with structured exercise to maintain remission. We apply the
latest knowledge on carbohydrate reduction and exercise to develop an
effective remission plan for people with type 2 diabetes, which aims to
be cost-effective, sustainable, and acceptable to individuals and
society. We expect that the intervention can be implemented in Denmark
as well as in other countries with comparable healthcare systems.

Hopefully, the trial will contribute to a reduced need for medical
treatment, improved overall health, new recommendations for
lifestyle-based remission of type 2 diabetes, and a cost-effective
approach that is implementable, scalable, and acceptable to patients
with type 2 diabetes.

## Funding

ON LiMiT is funded by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The grant amounts to
DKK 101,811,237. This sum covers the dietary and exercise intervention
as well as staff salaries.
