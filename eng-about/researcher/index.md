## About the Collaboration

ON LiMiT is a national scientific collaboration between researchers from
Steno Diabetes Center Aarhus, Copenhagen, and Odense, the University of
Copenhagen, and Bispebjerg Hospital.

## Goals and Ambitions

The goal is to develop and test a cost-effective strategy for diabetes
remission, which can be implemented in Denmark and internationally. The
project emphasizes sustainable solutions and collaboration between the
healthcare sector and municipalities. The project paves the way for new
strong national and international research collaborations within the
field.

The hope is that the ON LiMiT trial will be informative for health
authorities and national and international diabetes associations. It has
the potential to be transformative and change current guidelines for
type 2 diabetes. The involvement of Steno Diabetes Centers, general
practitioners, and municipalities, along with an ambition to include
local sports facilities to promote physical exercise in the trial, will
set a new standard for future multi-sector collaborations in the
management of type 2 diabetes.

## Access to Data

During the trial, samples will be collected and stored in a biobank.
This will enable later biochemical, proteomic, genomic, and metabolic
analyses as well as future projects.

The focused collection of biological, personal, and registry-based
results will be an enormous data resource for future research. We
anticipate that the impact of the ON LiMiT trial’s unique interventions
will affect central health parameters, including anthropometry,
metabolic risk markers, and, not least, the participants' quality of
life. Our centralized biobank and data storage allow us to perform
advanced association analyses, for example linking genetic profiles to
metabolic and physiological traits, comorbidities, and subjective
sensations and preferences in this large study. Additionally, the large
dataset will be used to connect with other large intervention trials.
The potential of linking large study databases within nutritional
science may prove to be transformative and further strengthen human
nutritional science.

## Scientific Background

Although calorie restriction can lead to remission of type 2 diabetes,
the underlying mechanisms of type 2 diabetes can also be influenced by
changes in dietary composition. There is currently an intense debate
among experts about whether carbohydrate-reduced diets, which contain
fewer carbohydrates and more protein and fat, or diets based on national
dietary guidelines (for example, the official Danish dietary
guidelines), which are higher in carbohydrates and lower in fat and
protein, should be recommended for people with type 2 diabetes.
Furthermore, the significant environmental impact of current food
systems emphasizes the need for a dietary transition toward more
plant-based diets, which is reflected in the official dietary guidelines
for the Danish population.

Despite the fact that type 2 diabetes is characterized by impaired
carbohydrate metabolism and that considerable emphasis has been placed
on more carbohydrate-reduced diets, both European and American
authorities recommend a wide range of carbohydrate intake, provided that
individuals consume high amounts of dietary fiber and limit their intake
of sugar and saturated fat. Notably, the recommended diets include both:

-   Carbohydrate-reduced diets (defined as 25-30 E% from carbohydrates).
-   The New Nordic Diet, which provides abundant amounts of
    carbohydrates (\>50 E%).

Moreover, carbohydrate-rich diets have shown almost equivalent effects
on glycemic control and weight loss compared with carbohydrate-reduced
diets in people with type 2 diabetes. This underscores the need for
further research, especially regarding their impact on weight-loss
maintenance and diabetes remission. The diverse recommendations
therefore create challenges in identifying the optimal diet for people
with type 2 diabetes. This is relevant when the goal is long-term
remission while also considering the environmental impact of dietary
choices for both healthcare professionals and people with type 2
diabetes in their efforts to identify the optimal dietary approach.

There is strong evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of type
2 diabetes, improves body weight regulation, and that intensive exercise
in combination with weight loss is effective in achieving type 2
diabetes remission.

## Research Questions

Whether a carbohydrate-reduced diet, a carbohydrate-rich diet, or both
are beneficial for people with type 2 diabetes after VLCD-induced weight
loss is unknown. The effects of combining carbohydrate-reduced or
carbohydrate-rich diets with exercise on type 2 diabetes remission and
weight-loss maintenance are currently unknown. Therefore, it is
necessary to thoroughly investigate diet-induced weight loss,
macronutrient composition, and exercise to optimize the management of
weight loss and glycemic control.
